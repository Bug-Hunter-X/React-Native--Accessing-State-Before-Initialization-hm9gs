This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native: accessing state variables before they've been initialized. The `Bug.js` file shows the problematic code, leading to undefined values.  The `BugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version using useEffect and a loading state to handle asynchronous updates and prevent crashes.  This is a critical concept for robust React Native development.
